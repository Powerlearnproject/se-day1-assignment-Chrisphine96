#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic approach to the developing, operation and maintenance of software and it entails infusing reliability, scalability and efficiency during the software development process. 
Its importance in the technology industry are evident through the ensuring of quality since software are reliable in their fulfilment of user needs. Secondly, they are cost efficient meaning that software ensure that individuals manage resources effectively through controlling errors and streamlining processes.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The emergence of software engineering in the 1950s through writing it in machine code is an important milestone because it lay the foundation for the current complicity in the field. Pioneers such as Alan Turing could decipher enigma’s contributing to the growth of computing and software engineering to solve common problems.
The waterfall model in the 1970s created a structured approach that would shape software engineering. It introduced sequential stages in analyzing requirements, designing, implementing, testing and deploying software. The software development stages remain crucial in informing approaches to developing new software by aligning functionality to the goals and the needs of the end user.
The agile methodology through platforms such as Scrum and Extreme programing revolutionized software engineering. Its development in the 1990s facilitated collaboration and flexibility in development since the process that involves people from diverse backgrounds with various levels of experience. For instance, agile methodology means that a backend and frontend engineer can work on the same project to ensure prompt delivery to the customer.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning and Requirement Analysis
This stage entails planning and getting the necessary information from customers through market surveys and information relating to sales. This is a key foundation stage for the project.
Defining Requirements
This stage entails the development of the Software Requirement Specification to record the software requirements. Customers, stakeholders and market analysts review these requirements to facilitate the development of software.
Design
The Software Requirement Specification facilitates the creation of architecture options for the software. The development of the Design Document Specification (DDS) is crucial in facilitating the selection of the most applicable design for the software.
Product Development
This stage features the actual coding of the software according to the design specifications generated from the previous stages. It allows programmers to choose from an array of languages such as Python, Java or HTML.
Product Testing
This stage allows for the testing of the product to identify defects. Its main goal is to ensure that the product meets set requirements and functions as intended.
Development and Maintenance
The product’s release occurs in phases and tested in the real world. Furthermore, it makes it easier to assess its performance. User feedback here ensures that monitoring and improvements occur easily.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Similarities between Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
These methods involve customers to generate the required information concerning the software.
Differences between Waterfall and Agile Methodologies.
The agile methodology is flexible and facilitates significant changes even late in the process. However, the waterfall method is sequential and does not facilitate any changes since one step precedes the next.
The agile method favors collaboration, meaning that it encourages intense customer involvement. However, the waterfall method does not favor collaboration in the long term.
The waterfall approach favors documentation in each stage, meaning that it is easier to access and maintain project records. Comparatively, the agile approach is highly flexible, meaning that there is no need for documentation since things might change.
The agile methodology is useful in startups and product development. The waterfall methodology is used in governemnt projects.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer
The roles and responsibilities entail writing and maintaining code, debugging code and collaborating with team members to infuse product features into the code.
The skills required are a proper understanding of programming languages, problem-solving and comprehending software design principles.
Quality Assurance Engineer
The responsibilities entail testing software to recognize bugs and ensure it meets the set quality standards. They also create and execute test plans and work with other developers to address issues.
The skills entail analysis, attentiveness and knowledge in different testing methodologies.
Project Manager
Project managers have the responsibility to plan and oversee the project, manage resources and timelines. Furthermore, they coordinate between shareholders and developing teams while ensuring that project goals are attained.
The required skills are communication, leadership and knowledge in project management


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are important because they provide debugging, writing and testing tools in a single application. Furthermore, they impact productivity by including features such as version control, code completion and debugging, ensuring that the software development process is successful. Examples include Visual Studio.
VCSs are important because they allow users to track changes made on their code over time. They also facilitate collaboration and manage various versions of software. Ultimately, code integrity is improved with teams collaborating efficiently. A common example of VCS is Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1.	Software systems tend to become more complex. Software engineers can overcome this challenge by proper documentation and always learning about these new changes in software engineering.
2.	Testing and quality assurance strategies complicate debugging processes. They can overcome this by using automation in testing such as using generative AI to check for issues in their code.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- These tests involve testing for individual components or functions of the software. Its importance is that it facilitates bug detection to ensure that the software fulfills its intended purpose.
Integration testing- This type of testing examines the degree of interaction between integrated components. Its importance is to guarantee that the combined parts work in tandem as required.
System testing- This tests the entire system to ensure that the entire system meets the specified requirements to function in the real world. Its importance is that it validates the entire system based on the requirements to match the real world.
Acceptance testing- This test measures how the software aligns with user requirements and business processes. Its importance is that it confirms whether the software satisfies user needs and its readiness for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering entails developing and refining inputs to AI models, especially LLM, to generate accurate and useful responses. It is vital in improving the effectiveness of AI-human interactions so that the outputs are relevant and precise, aligning with the given prompts.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Vague Prompt
Tell me about Kenya

Improved Prompt
Explain the main causes of the agitation for Kenyan independence after the Second World War.

Explanation
This prompt is specific such that it targets a specific aspect of Kenyan history, guiding the response the AI model will produce. Therefore, the output is likely to be relevant and useful since the AI model will accurately address the prompt.
